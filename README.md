The goal of replicate-batohs is to replicate (using simulated data) this chapter from my PhD thesis, which used jags, and show how to fit the equivalent model in greta.

PhD thesis chapter code:
https://github.com/njtierney/njtbatohs-chapter

Note that the data for this use case will be simulated, and some parts of the model will be simplified, such as removing the dust measurements.
